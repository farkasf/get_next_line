PROMETHEUS was the Titan god of forethought. 
He attempted to better the lives of his creation.
It brought him into conflict with Zeus. 
He stole fire from heaven and delivered it to mortal kind. 
As punishment for these rebellious acts, Zeus ordered the creation of Pandora.
Prometheus meanwhile, was arrested.
He was bound to a stake on Mount Kaukasos.
There, an eagle was set to feed upon his ever-regenerating liver. 
Generations later the great hero Herakles released the old Titan from his torture.
